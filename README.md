# goodfriend

goodfriend is an app designed to make it easy to keep track of the important events in the lives of the people you care about. It also has applications for small businesses - there is no better way to show you care than by remembering the important moments in the lives of your customers! If you can tailor your product to those events, even better :)

## Demo

Take a look at the app in [action](https://youtu.be/sjHAAJeoVFM) or visit it [live](https://goodfriend.netlify.app/)!

## Tech Stack
The front end uses React and Redux for managing state. The back end uses Ruby on Rails as an API and you can visit it [here](https://github.com/jzolo22/goodfriend-backend)!

## Project Status
Some potential improvements to come:

* the option to be private until friend request has been accepted
* the option to allocate users to different categories (i.e. close friends, family, acquaintances, customers, and see events for a whole category at once)

## Special Thanks
I couldn't have done it without these npm packages!
